# performance improvements

A few more additions to the dotnet framework to extend the suite of available functionalities. These include loop optimizations, inlining improvements, type checks and casts, ARM64 vectorization, ARM64 code generation, faster exceptions, code layout, reduced address exposure, AVX10v1 support, hardware intrinsic code generation, constant folding for floatin point and SIMD operations, ARM64 SVE support, and object stack allocation for boxes.

We will add some examples regarding these topics in project files and classes. **Note that for architecture specific features (arm64) we will try to emulate these somehow and explain on how they perform to previous versions of the framework.**
